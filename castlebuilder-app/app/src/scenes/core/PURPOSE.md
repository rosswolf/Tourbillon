## What goes here:

## When to use:
- Implementing new game mechanics
- Adding character abilities or actions
- Creating new entity types
- Building battle systems
- Managing game resources

## Key principles:
- Pure logic, no UI dependencies
- Functional programming preferred
- Immutable data structures
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable, isolated components
