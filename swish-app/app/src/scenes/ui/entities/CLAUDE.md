# Directory Context Instructions

## IMPORTANT: Read Directory Documentation First

Before making any changes in this directory, you MUST:

1. **Read PATTERNS.md** - Contains the architectural patterns and design decisions for this directory
2. **Read PURPOSE.md** - Explains the role and responsibilities of code in this directory

These files define the contracts and conventions that all code in this directory must follow.

## Why This Matters

- Each directory has specific architectural responsibilities
- PATTERNS.md defines HOW code should be structured
- PURPOSE.md defines WHAT code should do here
- Following these ensures consistency across the codebase

## Before You Code

Always check:
- Does my change align with the directory's PURPOSE?
- Am I following the PATTERNS defined for this directory?
- Am I maintaining the separation of concerns?

Violating directory patterns leads to architectural decay.
