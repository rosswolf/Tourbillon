# Tourbillon Build Archetypes & Strategies

## Overview

Tourbillon's tag system and force economy enable diverse build strategies. Each archetype focuses on different mechanical synergies and playstyles, from aggressive rushdown to intricate combo engines.

## Core Archetypes

**Playstyle:** Pack synergies and predator mechanics

**Strategy:**
- BEAST tags buff each other
- "Pack" bonuses for groups of 3+
- Sacrifice mechanics for burst
- Mobile, adaptive playstyle

**Key Cards:**
- Beast Cage - Damage per BEAST
- Pack Leader - "BEAST gears cost -1 tick"
- Shadow Pack - "When BEAST gear destroyed, all BEAST produce"
- Predator's Instinct - "Double damage vs wounded enemies"

**Strengths:**
- Strong tribal synergies
- Sacrifice for advantage
- Good vs multiple enemies
- Self-replacing engine

**Weaknesses:**
- Needs critical mass
- Vulnerable to single removal
- Force type limited
- Setup dependent

**Example Combo:**
- 5 BEAST gears on board
- Sacrifice one with Entropy
- Triggers all others to produce
- Each deals damage per BEAST count

### 6. CRYSTAL PRECISION - "The Clockmaker"
**Core Forces:** Precision + Balance
**Key Tags:** CRYSTAL, ORDER, TOOL
**Playstyle:** Perfect timing and control

**Strategy:**

- Precise, calculated plays

**Key Cards:**
- Crystal Synchronizer - "All gears fire in 3 ticks"

## Hybrid Builds

### MICRO-FORGE - "The Sweatshop"
Combines MICRO speed with FORGE efficiency. Many small gears with production bonuses.

### TITAN-VOID - "The Black Hole"
Slow TITAN chargers feeding a massive VOID consumption burst.

### ORDER-CHAOS - "Controlled Chaos"
Deliberately breaks ORDER patterns for CHAOS bonuses, then rebuilds.

## Build Progression

### Early Game (Acts 1-2)
- Focus on 1 primary force, 1 secondary
- Collect 3-4 gears of your main tag
- Basic converters and generators
- 1-2 draw engines

### Mid Game (Acts 3-4)
- Achieve critical mass (5+ of main tag)
- Add keyword gears (OVERBUILD, IMMOVABLE)
- Sophisticated converters
- Combo pieces

### Late Game (Acts 5+)
- Full archetype online
- Multiple win conditions
- Counter-disruption tools
- Explosive turns

## Countering Disruptions

Each build needs answers to common gremlin disruptions:

**vs Force Caps:** 
- MICRO: Stay under cap with frequency
- TITAN: Burst through cap quickly
- VOID: Consume before cap matters

**vs Timer Delays:**
- CRYSTAL: Timer manipulation
- CHAOS: Doesn't care about timing
- BEAST: Sacrifice to reset

**vs Gear Destruction:**
- TITAN: IMMOVABLE keyword
- FORGE: Redundant producers
- DUST: EPHEMERAL cycling

**vs Card Discard:**
- MICRO: High draw volume
- ARCANE: Mill synergies
- PRECISION: Selective draw

## Draft Priorities by Archetype

### MICRO Priority:
1. Any MICRO tag
2. Low tick costs (1-2)
3. Card draw
4. "Per MICRO" effects

### TITAN Priority:
1. IMMOVABLE keyword
2. High impact (5+ effect)
3. PATIENT keyword
4. Protection effects

### FORGE Priority:
1. Converters
2. Position bonuses
3. Efficiency keywords
4. Chain triggers

### CHAOS Priority:
1. Isolation bonuses
2. VOID consumption
3. Flexible costs
4. Board control

## Meta Considerations

- **Speed Kills:** MICRO dominates early acts
- **Inevitability Wins:** TITAN crushes late acts
- **Flexibility Survives:** ARCANE handles surprises
- **Synergy Scales:** BEAST/FORGE multiply power
- **Control Conquers:** CRYSTAL beats complex fights

The best players will recognize which archetype suits their drafted cards and pivot accordingly, rather than forcing a specific build.
