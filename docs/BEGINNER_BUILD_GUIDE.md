# Beginner's Guide to Tourbillon Builds

## Quick Start: Pick Your Playstyle

### 🔥 "I want to go FAST!" → MICRO SWARM
- **Forces:** Heat (red) + Precision (blue)
- **Look for:** MICRO, SPARK, TOOL tags
- **Strategy:** Play lots of cheap gears that fire every 1-2 ticks
- **Key insight:** 6 weak gears > 1 strong gear

### 🗿 "I want BIG effects!" → TITAN FORTRESS  
- **Forces:** Balance (white) + Entropy (black)
- **Look for:** TITAN, STONE, CRYSTAL tags
- **Strategy:** Play expensive gears that charge up for massive effects
- **Key insight:** Patience = Power

### ⚙️ "I like combos!" → FORGE CHAIN
- **Forces:** Momentum (green) + Heat (red)
- **Look for:** FORGE, MECH, ORDER tags
- **Strategy:** Build chains that convert forces efficiently
- **Key insight:** A → B → C → Damage

### 🌀 "I'm weird!" → CHAOS VOID
- **Forces:** Entropy (black) + whatever
- **Look for:** CHAOS, VOID, SHADOW tags
- **Strategy:** Keep gears isolated for bonuses
- **Key insight:** Alone = Strong

### 🐺 "Pack tactics!" → BEAST PACK
- **Forces:** Momentum (green) + Entropy (black)
- **Look for:** BEAST, SHADOW tags
- **Strategy:** Multiple BEAST gears buffing each other
- **Key insight:** Strength in numbers

## Your First 3 Card Choices

When offered cards, ask yourself:

1. **"Does this match my main tag?"** (MICRO, TITAN, etc.)
2. **"Does this produce my main force?"** (Heat, Balance, etc.)
3. **"Does this help me draw cards?"** (Critical!)

## Simple Decision Tree

```
Starting a run?
├─ Pick an archetype above
├─ Focus on 2 force types max
├─ Grab every card with your main tag
└─ Always take card draw

Mid-run struggling?
├─ Too slow? → Add MICRO/SPARK cards
├─ Not enough damage? → Add converters
├─ Hand always empty? → Add draw engines
└─ Gears keep dying? → Add IMMOVABLE

Late run optimization?
├─ Have 5+ of your tag? → Take "per [TAG]" bonuses
├─ Have good engine? → Add keywords (OVERBUILD, etc.)
└─ Need finisher? → Big burst damage cards
```

## Force Combinations That Work

### Beginner Friendly Pairs
- **Heat + Precision** = Speed & cards
- **Balance + Momentum** = Defense & scaling
- **Heat + Entropy** = Damage & sacrifice

### Avoid These Pairs (harder to play)
- **Precision + Entropy** = Conflicting goals
- **Balance + Heat** = Too defensive
- **All 5 forces** = Jack of all trades, master of none

## Red Flags: You're Doing It Wrong

❌ **Your mainplate has 1 of everything** → Pick a theme!
❌ **You have 8 different tags** → Focus on 2-3 tags
❌ **No card draw gears** → You'll lose to empty hand
❌ **Only damage, no generation** → Unsustainable
❌ **Only generation, no damage** → Can't win

## The "Safe" Starter Build

If confused, default to this:

1. **Main Tag:** MICRO
2. **Forces:** Heat (damage) + Precision (cards)
3. **Card Priority:**
   - Any MICRO tag
   - "Draw card" effects
   - Heat generators
   - Simple damage dealers

This build is:
- Easy to understand
- Forgiving of mistakes
- Available in most runs
- Strong enough to win

## When to Pivot

Sometimes your build isn't coming together. Pivot when:

- **By Act 2:** You have <3 cards of your main tag
- **By Act 3:** Your damage output is <5 per cycle
- **Any time:** You get a RARE card for a different build

## Common Noob Traps

### Trap: "This RARE card is good!"
**Reality:** A RARE off-build card < COMMON on-build card

### Trap: "I need all 5 forces!"
**Reality:** 2 forces done well > 5 forces done poorly

### Trap: "Big numbers = better!"
**Reality:** 2 damage every 2 ticks > 10 damage every 15 ticks

### Trap: "Fill every mainplate slot!"
**Reality:** Empty slots are fine if your gears synergize

### Trap: "Save cards for later!"
**Reality:** Play cards NOW, draw MORE cards

## Quick Power Assessment

Count your:
- **Damage per 10 ticks** (Should be 15+ by Act 3)
- **Cards drawn per 10 ticks** (Should be 2+)
- **Main tag count** (Should be 5+ by Act 3)

If any are low, prioritize fixing that weakness.

## The 80/20 Rule

80% of wins come from:
- Having enough card draw (3+ sources)
- Focusing on one archetype
- Converting forces to damage efficiently
- Playing cards quickly (don't hoard)

Don't overthink the other 20%!

## TL;DR - Just Tell Me What to Do

1. Pick MICRO SWARM (easiest)
2. Take every MICRO tag card
3. Use Heat for damage
4. Use Precision for cards
5. Play gears fast, don't overthink
6. Win by tick 30

Good luck, Horologist!
